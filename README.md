This project involves predicting Apple stock prices using SimpleRNN and LSTM models. The dataset is preprocessed by selecting the 'Adj Close' price and scaling it for better model performance. The models are built using TensorFlow Keras, incorporating layers to capture sequential dependencies and prevent overfitting. After compiling and training the models with early stopping and saving them using pickle, predictions are made on the test set, and performance is evaluated through visualizations and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Ultimately, while the models effectively capture stock price trends, they are sensitive to market fluctuations, suggesting that future improvements could include additional features like news sentiment and macroeconomic indicators.
